# MelonCAN
Teensy 3.1/3.2 library for using FlexCAN and MCP_CAN in a unified way.

Uses the FlexCAN CAN_message_t structs for building messages, but allows these messages to either be handled by the FlexCAN controller or by an external MCP2515 controller through SPI.

Requires [MCP_CAN library](https://github.com/coryjfowler/MCP_CAN_lib)  
Requires [FlexCAN for Teensy 3.1/3.2](https://github.com/teachop/FlexCAN_Library)

Feel free to ask questions.  Pull requests welcome.
