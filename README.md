# MelonCAN
Teensy 3.1/3.2 library for using FlexCAN and MCP_CAN in a unified way.

Uses the FlexCAN CAN_message_t structs for building messages, but allows these messages to either be handled by the FlexCAN controller or by an external MCP2515 controller through SPI.

Feel free to ask questions.  Pull requests welcome.
